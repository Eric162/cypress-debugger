# Cypress Debugger - plugin file implementation

Capture and replay Cypress Tests. Debug your failed and flaky CI cypress tests by replaying execution traces.

- Cypress test execution steps
- DOM snapshots
- network requests (HAR)
- browser console logs

The plugin captures and replays everything that's happening in Cypress tests, think of it as Playwright traces for Cypress.
